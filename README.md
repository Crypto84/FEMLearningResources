# FEM Learning Resources

Hello! My name is Kyle Morris and welcome to the FEM Learning Resources repository. This repository will be used to store all Jupyter Notebooks, setup documents and exercises related to my final year project on the Finite Element Method.

## What is the project all about?
My project is about the creation of learning resources for the understanding and use of the Finite Element Method (FEM) in Python. Through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, I endeavour to teach the subject in the most engaging, interesting and effective way possible. To achieve this, I will be taking an evidence-based approach where I review methods from published literature and studies on mathematical education. The goal is then to obtain the best possible solutions and compile them into a course on FEM.

Once the outline has been created, I can begin the development which will follow an agile methodology. It will include rapid phases of development, followed by user testing, followed by amendments if necessary. Then, once all notebooks have been tested and the course has been effectively completed, I will get a final response from researchers in the field, giving their opinions on the material as a whole. I can then use this data to evaluate the success of the project and to motivate any further work in the field.

## Aims & Objectives for the project

Key objectives for the project include:

* To gain a good enough understanding of Finite Element Analysis for me to write effective learning material on the subject.

* To research good educational practice. I.e. How to most effectively engage students and maximise retention.

* To follow an agile development methodology and use it to create notebooks in an efficient, user-led manner.

* To evaluate the effectiveness of the notebooks by comparing user responses to published literature.

## Testers Information

Development will take place over the course of roughly 4 weeks. Over that time, I will routinely create the notebooks and it will be your role to test them. I will provide testing rubrics in the form of questionnaires, and for each notebook, you will be tasked with reading through it and attempting any ‘check’ exercises. Then you should fill out the questionnaire to provide me with immediate feedback on how I can improve the product. The questionnaires will be hosted on Google Forms, with a link to them being provided here when they are created. Thank you for choosing to participate in the project! It means a lot to me and will be an invaluable addition to the work. Your contributions will allow the project to reach a level of refinement that would not have otherwise been possible.
